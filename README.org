* ProfApp
  An application to assist a university professor with his data
  management.

** Roadmap
   There is still very very much to do before this is alpha. This is a
   roadmap mockup:

   - Buildout project structure.

   - List/Create/Update/Delete each content type:

     - Student :: This represents a student, ideally it should
                  communicate with LDAP.

     - Semester Subject :: This is a subject per semesster.  Each
          semester a professor should need to create a new set of
          these for each subject.

     - Exam :: This is an exam.

     - Grade :: A student's grade on a specific exam.

   - Copy semester subjects from old years.

   - Grade exports for semester subjects.

   - Graphic design

   - Searching: Find a smart way to make searching efficient.

   - Professor accounts.
